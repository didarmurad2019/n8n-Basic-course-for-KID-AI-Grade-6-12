Action node = “…do this!”
<br>

<br>
Skills:
<br>
Keyword matching.
<br>
Sending replies.
<br>
Using Switch nodes.

Module 5: Data Fun
🎯 Goal: Work with data using n8n.
<br>
Activities:
<br>
Save daily mood check-in responses to Google Sheets.
<br>
Generate a graph of study hours → share via email.
<br>
Concepts:
<br>
Data flows.
<br>
Collect → Store → Visualize.
<br>
Module 6: Creative Projects
🎯 Goal: Kids design their own mini-projects.
<br>

Final Project 🎓
Each student builds their own kids-friendly chatbot or automation:

Example: “Good Morning Quote Sender”
<br>
Example: “Daily Science Fact Mailer”
<br>
They present it to the class, explaining triggers, actions, and logic.
<br>
⚡ By the end, kids understand logic, data flow, problem-solving, and creativity — all through fun projects without heavy coding.
